    "In fact, DNA circuits are always composed of DNA strand displacement. And DNA strand displacement can be represented by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A + B \\xrightarrow[]{k} C + D$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is observed by researchers that the DNA strand displacement is a kind of [second-order reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_reaction), where the rate may be proportional to one concentration squared $r = k[A]^2$, or (more commonly) to the product of two concentrations $r = k[A][B]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "note: [X] stands for the concentration of X.\n",

    "The curves of the second-order reaction may look like this (corresponding to the concentration of C in the reaction above, and the reaction occurs in step 100):\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, the rate equation is: $r = -\\frac{dA}{dt} = -\\frac{dB}{dt} = \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{dD}{dt} = k[A][B]$\n",
    "\n",
    "And at the same time, we have the mass balance equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[A_0] - [A] = [B_0] - [B] = [C] = [D]$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $[A_0]$, $[B_0]$ are the initial concentrations of A and B, respectively. For simplicity, we assume the initial concentrations of A and B are the same: \n",
    "\n",
    "$[A_0] = [B_0]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to obtain the relationship between the concentration of the product [C] and time t. So we have two methods to address the problem:\n"
